w3's basic html dynamic section is also a good resource.


Also, see the sass mixin for style props for element containing the img and the style props for the image itself. 
Keep in mind, that in order to make DOM elements dynamic, the dynamic elements resize according some default value: that default value is the px size of the screen--> 
typically that size is 960px for the content-width <--see src/assests/sass/presets/_variables.scss. 

Also just as important, the <meta> el in apps root index.html needs to define the content width of the browser window:  <meta> el's content attr needs to include the : 
	- width, 
	- initial-scale,  
	- shink to fit.
